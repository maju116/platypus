# A reference page generated from the schema cannot contradict the code. A guide written by
# hand can, and the failure is the expensive kind: somebody copies a block, it is refused,
# and the documentation taught them a mistake. Writing the engine's half of this guide
# produced three of those before the prose was finished - `model_checkpoint` has no `mode`,
# it does require a `path`, and `anchors: auto` is not a thing.
#
# The section titles are pinned because pyplatypus's guide walks the same ones, in
# tests/test_guide.py. Neither repository can see the other, so the list is written out in
# both with a comment saying so.
