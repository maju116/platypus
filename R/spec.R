# The specification: the one thing R and Python agree on.
#
# Built from arguments or read from a YAML file, and nothing downstream can tell which.
# That is the whole contract - a colleague can hand you their configuration file, you can
# hand them your R script, and both describe the same experiment.

#' Where the images and masks are
#'
#' Two layouts. `nested_dirs` expects one directory per sample containing an `images` and
#' a `masks` subdirectory - the Data Science Bowl arrangement, where a sample may hold
#' dozens of separate mask files that are combined into one. `config_file` expects a CSV
#' with `images` and `masks` columns, several paths per cell if needed, resolved relative
#' to the file itself so a configuration travels with its data.
#'
#' Classes are named one of two ways, and exactly one of them. `colormap` is for masks
#' stored as pictures: a list of RGB triples where position is the class index. `labels` is
#' for masks stored as label maps - a vector of the voxel values, in class order - which is
#' how every volume format stores them, and how a single-channel PNG can be read as well.
#'
#' A sample that is missing its masks is an error, not a warning - a warning in a loop over
#' five hundred directories is a warning nobody reads.
#'
#' @param train,validation Paths to the training and validation data. A
#'   [split_dataset()] may be given as `train` on its own: it carries all three
#'   paths and selects `config_file` mode, so a split needs no unpacking.
#'
#'   **`validation = FALSE` says this run has no validation set**, which is the third and
#'   last answer to the question `validation` and `split` both answer - a final fit on
#'   every case you have, once the hyperparameters are settled. It goes in this argument
#'   rather than a new one because it is the same question, and a second argument could
#'   contradict the first.
#'
#'   Leaving `validation` and `split` *both* unset is still an error, and that is
#'   deliberate: "I have no validation set" and "I forgot" look identical, and only one of
#'   them is a decision.
#' @param test Optional test data. Only images are read from it.
#' @param split Divide `train` instead of naming a `validation` set: a list with
#'   `fractions` (two numbers, or three to cut a test set as well) and `group_by`. Exactly
#'   one of `split`, `validation`, and `validation = FALSE`.
#'
#'   **`group_by` has to be given, even as `NULL`.** It is a regular expression read
#'   against each sample's name, and everything sharing a group lands in a single split -
#'   usually a patient, sometimes a study or a scanner. `NULL` divides by file instead, and
#'   is a perfectly good answer when the images are independent.
#'
#'   It is required rather than optional because the mistake it prevents leaves no trace:
#'   slices of one patient in training and validation at once make validation measure
#'   memory rather than generalisation, and the score comes out several points too high
#'   with nothing in the output to say so.
#'
#'   Nothing is written. [split_dataset()] is still the way when the three CSV files are
#'   the point - to keep, to hand to a colleague, to cite - and its result can be passed
#'   straight to `train`.
#' @param colormap A list of RGB triples, one per class, background first. For masks stored
#'   as pictures. Give this or `labels`, not both.
#' @param labels The voxel value of each class, in class order, for masks stored as label
#'   maps - `c(0, 1)` for a binary segmentation, `c(0, 1, 2)` where 1 is liver and 2 is
#'   tumour. This is how NIfTI and every other volume format label anything. Give this or
#'   `colormap`, not both.
#' @param mode `"nested_dirs"` or `"config_file"`.
#' @param window How values in real units reach the model. A named window - `"lung"`,
#'   `"soft_tissue"`, `"bone"`, `"brain"`, `"abdomen"`, `"liver"`, `"mediastinum"`,
#'   `"subdural"`, `"stroke"` - or an explicit `c(centre, width)` in Hounsfield units, or
#'   `"auto"` for the window the file recorded, which only DICOM has, or `"full"` for the
#'   whole range present. Applies to DICOM and to NIfTI; ignored for ordinary pictures,
#'   which are already 0-255.
#'
#'   Worth choosing rather than leaving: a fixed window is what makes two scans comparable.
#'   Scaling each scan by its own darkest and brightest voxel lets a single metal implant or
#'   marker rescale everything else in it.
#'
#'   `NULL`, the default, sends nothing and lets the engine decide - which also keeps
#'   ordinary image work running against an engine too old to know the setting exists.
#' @param dicom_window The former name of `window`, still accepted. It was accurate while
#'   DICOM was the only format that needed it.
#' @param channels_from For datasets that keep one channel per file: one pattern per channel,
#'   in channel order. BraTS ships four MRI sequences per patient - T1, T1 after contrast, T2
#'   and FLAIR - because different tumour structures are visible in different sequences;
#'   satellite sets keep their bands apart the same way.
#'
#'   The order is stated rather than inferred, and that is the point. Sorted, the BraTS names
#'   come out flair, t1, t1ce, t2 - reproducible and anatomically meaningless. A model trained
#'   with FLAIR in channel one and used on data whose channel one is T1 returns a plausible
#'   answer with the right shape and the right range, and nothing further down can notice.
#'
#'   Patterns are Python regular expressions, like `group_by` in [split_dataset()], and R's
#'   own quoting applies: `c("_t1\\.nii", "_t1ce\\.nii", "_t2\\.nii", "_flair\\.nii")`.
#'   Each must match exactly one of a sample's files - `"_t1"` would match both `_t1.nii.gz`
#'   and `_t1ce.nii.gz`, which is an error rather than a race - and every file must be claimed
#'   by some pattern, because one left out is data the model never sees.
#' @param target_spacing For volumes: resample every scan to this many millimetres per voxel,
#'   then centre-crop or pad to the model's `input_shape`. Without it a volume is simply
#'   resized into that shape, which is only harmless when every scan covers the same amount of
#'   the patient - and clinical scans do not. Forty slices of 1 mm is 40 mm of patient and
#'   forty of 2.5 mm is 100 mm, so resizing alone leaves the same organ a different size in
#'   each, and nothing in the data says so.
#'
#'   `c(1, 1, 1)` is the usual starting point. Ignored for 2D.
#' @param subdirs For `nested_dirs`, the names of the image and mask subdirectories.
#' @param column_sep For `config_file`, what separates several paths in one cell.
#' @param shuffle Shuffle the training data between epochs.
#' @return A data specification, to be passed to [platypus_spec()].
