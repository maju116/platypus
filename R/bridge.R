# The bridge to the engine.
#
# Everything this package does eventually happens in Python. The point of this file is
# that a user never has to know that: no interpreter to choose, no environment to
# activate, no version to match. reticulate::py_require() declares what is needed and uv
# builds an isolated environment for it on first use.
#
# That isolation is the whole design. The R keras and tensorflow packages of 2020 shared
# one Python installation with whatever else the user had, so an unrelated change on the
# Python side could break an R session. Nothing here touches a Python anyone else uses.

#' The exact engine this version of platypus speaks to
#'
#' Pinned rather than ranged on purpose: pyplatypus is an alpha whose API still moves,
#' and an R package should not break because a Python dependency drifted underneath it.

    # environment is built by this package, and leaving either out means a documented
    # feature that cannot work for anybody.
    #
    # That was not hypothetical for `hub`: `weights = "dsbowl-unet"` was unusable from R in
    # every release that had it, and nothing in either test suite could see it, because the
    # pin's test surface is the package and never its extras. The only thing that found it

    # which is not a trade worth making someone opt into.
