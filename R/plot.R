# Pictures.
#
# The package's reason for existing, as much as the training is. Getting from a folder of
# images to a figure that can go in a paper is the job; a model is the middle of it.

#' Read images as the model sees them
#'
#' Reads through the engine's own pipeline rather than a separate decoder, so what you
#' plot is what the model was given. A picture drawn from a differently resized copy is a
#' picture of something the model never saw, and the disagreements it appears to show may
#' be nothing but the resizing.
#'
#' @param paths Image files.
#' @param size `c(height, width)` to read at, or `NULL` to keep each image's own size -
#'   which only works if they all agree.
#' @param channels 3 for colour, 1 for greyscale.
#' @param nearest Use nearest-neighbour resizing. Required for masks: interpolating one
#'   invents colours belonging to no class, which then quietly become background.
#' @return An `image x height x width x channels` array of 0-255 values.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' images <- read_images(list.files("test/", full.names = TRUE), size = c(256, 256))

#' Look at masks beside the images they came from
#'
#' Builds a grid: one row per image, one column per panel. Which panels appear depends on
#' what you pass - the image alone, the truth, the prediction, and where they disagree.
#'
#' The disagreement panel is usually the one worth looking at. It separates what was found
#' from what was missed and what was invented, and those are not interchangeable: for most
#' clinical questions a missed lesion and a false alarm cost different things, and a single
#' overlap score hides which one you have.
#'
#' @param images An `image x height x width x channels` array, or one
#'   `height x width x channels` image.
#' @param prediction Predicted class indices, from [predict.platypus_fit()].
#' @param truth True class indices, if you have them.
#' @param colormap A list of RGB triples, one per class.
#' @param which Which images to show.
#' @param alpha How strongly to tint the overlays.
#' @param labels Row labels; defaults to the image number.
#' @param slice For volumes, which slice to draw. A volume cannot honestly be shown as one
#'   picture, so one plane is chosen and said out loud rather than a projection being
#'   invented. Counted along the last axis, which after the canonical reorientation is the
#'   axial direction - the view a radiologist scrolls through. `"middle"` takes the middle
#'   slice, which is the sensible first look.

#' Draw boxes on images
#'
#' The detection counterpart of [plot_masks()], and the function the 2020 package had under
#' this name. Boxes arrive from [predict()] in each image's own pixels, so they land on the
#' picture without anything being undone first.
#'
#' Predictions and truth can be drawn together, and when they are, the point is the
#' comparison: truth in one colour, predictions in another, both on the same image. A
#' detector that found the right number of objects in the wrong places and one that found
#' the wrong number in the right places score similarly and look nothing alike.
#'
#' @param images An image stack from [read_images()], or a single image.
#' @param boxes Boxes to draw: one data frame as [predict()] returns per image, or a list
#'   of them - one per image in `images`. Columns `xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`, and
#'   optionally `name` and `score`.
#' @param truth Boxes to draw as ground truth, the same shape as `boxes`.
#' @param which Which images to draw. Defaults to the first four, like [plot_masks()].
#' @param min_score Drop predicted boxes below this confidence before drawing. The default
#'   follows a detector's own `score_threshold` of 0.01, which is kept low so average
#'   precision can be computed over the whole ranking - and which puts far more boxes on a
#'   picture than anyone wants to look at. `0.5` is the usual choice for a figure.
#' @param labels Row labels. Defaults to the names of `boxes`, which [predict()] sets to
#'   the sample keys.
#' @param colours Named vector giving the colour for `prediction` and for `truth`.
#' @param size Line width of a box.
#' @param text_size Size of the class label, or `NULL` to draw no labels.

#' Draw the anchors against the boxes they were fitted to
#'
#' The picture the 2020 package drew, and the one no summary statistic replaces. Every
#' annotated box is a point - its width against its height, both as fractions of the
#' model's input - coloured by class, with the anchors on top.
#'
#' What it answers that a mean overlap does not: **whether a class has any anchor near it
#' at all**. A mean of 0.65 can be one class covered well and another not covered at all,
#' and those two situations want different fixes. On blood cells the three classes occupy
#' three distinct regions - median sides of 133, 69 and 26 pixels at a 416 input - and
#' anchors fitted to all three together cover them at 0.88, 0.85 and 0.83, so fitting to
#' the mixture does not abandon the smallest class. COCO's nine cover the same three at
#' 0.64, 0.70 and 0.70: *evenly* worse rather than blind to one, which is the useful thing
#' to know. They are not aimed elsewhere - they span 10 to 373 pixels a side because COCO
#' holds objects of every size, and most of that range describes nothing here.
#'
#' Worth drawing for a split the anchors were **not** fitted on. Anchors that sit among the
#' training boxes and away from the validation ones say the two halves hold different
#' objects, and no training curve shows that.

#' @param object A fit from [platypus_fit()] on a detection specification.

#' @param split Which split's boxes to draw.

#'   - a BCCD platelet is about two fifths the side of a red cell and a fifth of a white
